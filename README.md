## Cost of Living
### Mid_term_project DA_OCT23

#### Members of the group:

#### Goal of the project:

Our aim is to explore the influence of different factors on the cost of living, looking at variations across continents and countries. Through this research, we seek to understand the relationships between different variables and their impact on the cost of living in different locations.

The initial step involved cleaning the data, addressing missing values, handling outliers, and exploring the dataset to grasp its distribution and variable relationships.

In addition to exploratory analysis, we opted to employ a machine learning model. This required data preparation, including converting categorical variables (such as city and country) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding. We standardized numerical features to ensure consistency in scale and then split the dataset into training and test sets.

Utilizing scikit-learn libraries, we implemented a linear regression model for prediction. The model was trained on the training set, and its performance was evaluated on the test set using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared.

Tableau and Python were used to visualise and validate our conclusions.

# Mid_term_project DA_OCT23

#### Members of the group:
Carmen Matos, 
Dominik Koppen

#### Goal of the project:

The project aims to predict the cost of living using machine learning, specifically linear regression. 
The dataset includes various factors such as food prices, transport costs, housing costs and more across different 
cities and countries. 

A linear regression model is trained on a subset of the data and its performance is evaluated using metrics such 
as mean squared error. The final model allows the prediction of the cost of living based on the input features. 
The project provides insight into the relationships between different variables and their impact on the 
cost of living in different locations.


#### Brief description of the dataset:

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living)

Number of rows: 4874 rows

Number of features: 59 columns

#### Project Plan:

### Day 1
Clean data/EDA
- Deal with any missing values
- Check and deal with outliers in the data
- Exploring the data to understand its distribution and relationships between variables

### Day 2
Transforming the data
- Convert categorical variables (city and country) to numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding
- Standardise or normalise numerical features to put them on a similar scale
- Split the data set into training and test sets

### Day 3 
Modelling
- Use linear regression to build the predictive model using scikit-learn libraries
- Train the model on the training set
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using the metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared.

### Day 4
Predictions/Visualisations
- Make predictions on new data examples
- Visualise the results, plotting predicted values against actual values
- Prepare a presentation

### Day 5
Presentation day

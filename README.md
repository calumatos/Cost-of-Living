# Mid_term_project DA_OCT23

#### Members of the group:
Carmen Matos,

#### Goal of the project:

Our main objective is to explore how different factors affect the cost of living by analysing cost variations across continents and countries. 
The project provides insight into the relationships between different variables and their impact on the cost of living in different locations.

The dataset includes various factors such as food prices, transport costs, housing costs and more across different cities and countries. 
cities and countries. 


#### Brief description of the dataset:

Source: Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living)

Number of rows: 4874 rows

Number of features: 59 columns

#### Project Plan:

### Day 1
Clean data/EDA
- Deal with any missing values
- Check and deal with outliers in the data
- Exploring the data to understand its distribution and relationships between variables

### Day 2
Transforming the data
- Convert categorical variables (city and country) to numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding
- Standardise or normalise numerical features to put them on a similar scale
- Split the data set into training and test sets

### Day 3 
Modelling
- Use linear regression to build the predictive model using scikit-learn libraries
- Train the model on the training set
- Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using the metrics Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or R-squared.

### Day 4
Predictions/Visualisations
- Make predictions on new data examples
- Visualise the results, plotting predicted values against actual values
- Prepare a presentation

### Day 5
Presentation day
